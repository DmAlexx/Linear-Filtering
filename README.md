# Good (reasonable) value for amount: Typically, values in the range of 0 to 3 are considered reasonable, 
# as they provide sufficient sharpening to enhance the visual perception of the image while preserving a natural
# appearance and minimizing the appearance of artifacts.

# Too small value of amount: With a too small value of amount, the sharpening effect will be minimal or even unnoticeable, 
# making the use of the method impractical.

# Too large value of amount: If the value of amount is too large, there is an excessive sharpening effect,
# which can lead to the appearance of noise, artifacts, and distortions in the image, making it less natural and appealing.
